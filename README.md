## Documentation
All the technical documentation (destinated to potential contributors) can be found directly in the source code: there's quite a lot of JavaDoc, so understanding the source code shouldn't be a problem. From an user point of view, all the documentation can be found [on the JTelegraph dedicated website](http://cereda.github.com/jtelegraph/). Some advanced documentation can also be found on [our GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/cereda/jtelegraph/wiki).
